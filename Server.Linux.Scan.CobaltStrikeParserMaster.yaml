description: |

  This artifact deploys CobaltStrikeParser-master in order to scan PEs, memory dumps or urls for Cobalt Strike beacons and parse their configuration.
  
  The tool must be first uploaded and installed properly on a directory on the server.
  
  You can use it as enrichment for uploaded files to server, or for urls.
